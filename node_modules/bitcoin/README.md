# node-bitcoin

node-bitcoin is a simple wrapper for the Bitcoin client's JSON-RPC API.

The API is equivalent to the API document [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list).
The methods are exposed as lower camelcase methods on the `bitcoin.Client`
object.

## Install

`npm install bitcoin`

## Setup

1. Traverse to `~/.bitcoin` or `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin` and add a
file called `bitcoin.conf` if it doesn't already exist.

2. Add these lines to the file:

    rpcuser=username

    rpcpassword=password

You will use these to login to the server.

3. Start your Bitcoin client with the `-server` argument or run `bitcoind`

4. You should now be able to communicate with Bitcoin JSON-RPC API using the
node-bitcoin library, try it out!

## Example

    var bitcoin = require('bitcoin');
    var client = new bitcoin.Client('localhost', 8332, 'username', 'password');

    client.getBalance(function(err, balance) {
      if (err) return console.log(err);
      console.log("Balance:", balance);
    });
